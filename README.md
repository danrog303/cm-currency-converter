Polish version of readme file üáµüá± [is available here](https://github.com/danrog303/cm-currency-converter/blob/main/README.pl.md).

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is this project?
**cm-currency-converter** (in short ccc) is a browser extension that enables price conversion on https://cardmarket.com. By default, the website displays prices only in Euros, but with the use of the extension, it is possible to convert prices to any currency of your choice.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to use the extension?
1. Install the Tampermonkey extension

   - Safari: [link](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1482490089?mt=8)
2. Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danrog303/cm-currency-converter/main/userscript-client/ccc.user.js) to call the user script installer
3. Install the script by following on-screen instructions

By default, the script converts prices from EUR to PLN. The target currency can be changed by editing the **userCurrencyCode** and **userCurrencyDisplaySymbol** variables in the script code.

## üèó Project structure
The project consists of two parts:
1. **user-script-client**:  
   - Tampermonkey userscript that fetches currency exchange rates from **api-lambda** and replaces prices on the website
2. **api-lambda**:  
   - AWS Lambda function that retrieves currency exchange rates from https://exchangerate-api.com and caches the result in a DynamoDB table
   - Working instance of the lambda function is available here: https://currency.danielrogowski.net/eur/usd
